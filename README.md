# Python
Several scripts written in Python, to accomplish varying tasks.

## MacChaningDaemon.py
Creates a daemon to change the mac address on an interface once per hour (far too aggressive, I'm aware).

## CheckSockets.py
Attempts to open a socket and, if blocked, then finds out what process in currently utilising that socket.

## SvenskaVeckanNummer.py
Original skeleton for the script that's used in Docker (see: Docker/SwedishWeekNumber)
